      <h1>Benefits of Reading Books: How It Can Positively Affect Your Life</h1>
      <p>
        In the 11th century, a Japanese woman known as Murasaki Shikibu wrote “The
        Tale of Genji,” a 54-chapter story of courtly seduction believed to be the
        world’s first novel. Over 1,000 years later, people the world over are
        still engrossed by novels — even in an era where stories appear on
        handheld screens and disappear 24 hours later. What exactly do human
        beings get from reading books? Is it just a matter of pleasure, or are
        there benefits beyond enjoyment? The scientific answer is a resounding
        “yes.” Reading books benefits both your physical and mental health, and
        those benefits can last a lifetime. They begin in early childhood and
        continue through the senior years. Here’s a brief explanation of how
        reading books can change your brain — and your body — for the better.
        Reading strengthens your brain A growing body of research indicates that
        reading literally changes your mind. Using MRI scans, researchers have
        confirmedTrusted Source that reading involves a complex network of
        circuits and signals in the brain. As your reading ability matures, those
        networks also get stronger and more sophisticated. In one studyTrusted
        Source conducted in 2013, researchers used functional MRI scans to measure
        the effect of reading a novel on the brain. Study participants read the
        novel “Pompeii” over a period of 9 days. As tension built in the story,
        more and more areas of the brain lit up with activity. Brain scans showed
        that throughout the reading period and for days afterward, brain
        connectivity increased, especially in the somatosensory cortex, the part
        of the brain that responds to physical sensations like movement and pain.
